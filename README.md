Real News vs. Fake News

Overview

In the age of digital information, distinguishing between real news and fake news has become a significant challenge. This project aims to solve this problem using machine learning (ML) techniques, leveraging various technologies such as Python, Scikit-learn, and other data analysis and visualization tools. By utilizing a dataset that includes both real and fake news articles, our goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a given news article is real or fake.

The project will clean and preprocess the data, apply a machine learning model, and then optimize it to maximize prediction accuracy. The results will be evaluated based on classification accuracy or R-squared metrics. To visualize the data and present the results, technologies like Python Pandas, Matplotlib, and possibly Tableau will be used.

Methodology

1. Data Collection:
The dataset used in this project contains at least 100 records, each corresponding to a news article labeled as either "real" or "fake." The dataset will be sourced from publicly available datasets on platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Before applying the machine learning model, the data will undergo the following preprocessing steps:

Cleaning: Remove any missing values, irrelevant columns, or erroneous data.
Normalization and Standardization: Scale numerical data to ensure that all features are comparable in magnitude, improving model training performance.
Feature Extraction: Extract important features from text, such as word count, sentiment, and frequency of specific keywords using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. Model Building:
The project will use Scikit-learn or another appropriate ML library to implement a classification model. Potential models include:

Logistic Regression: A baseline classifier for binary classification.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): For creating a hyperplane that separates the data classes.
Random Forest: An ensemble method for better classification accuracy.
4. Model Optimization:
To enhance model performance, hyperparameter tuning will be performed using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV. The model will be evaluated using cross-validation, and the resulting classification accuracy will be displayed.

5. Data Visualization:
The results will be visualized using Python Matplotlib or JavaScript Plotly to represent model performance and dataset features. The goal is to make the data and results comprehensible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Results

Upon completion of model training and evaluation, we will present the following key results:

Model Performance: The final model will achieve at least 75% classification accuracy, or 0.80 R-squared for regression models. The performance will be documented, including iterative changes made during model optimization.
Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of classification performance will be provided, showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Accuracy Over Time: A graph showing the change in accuracy as different optimization techniques are applied.
Additionally, the results will be compared with a baseline model to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimizations and the machine learning model in predicting real vs. fake news.
